HARK_THE_HERALD = int main()
JINGLE = cout
ADVENT = 25
ROCKING_AROUND_THE_CHRISTMAS_TREE = Message greeting + fixed 25 iteration loop (See explaination)
SILVER_BELLS = " Days until Christmas\n"
THE_GRINCH cin.get();


Explaination:
When you're rocking around the christmas tree, what you do you find falling off of it? Snow of course!
For the usage of this 25-iteration fixed loop, you're currently rocking, hence, there is no "i" in this loop, only snow.
Example usage: WearCoat(Coats[snow]);
